# Silent Warning App

This app warns a user on submiting a ticket as public reply is silent is triggered.

* If reply is a public reply AND silent is set:
* Toggle silent option within modal box
* Cancel modal without submiting ticket to go back and check ticket details

### Bugs

* Occasionaly locks up on cancel (or on submit?!?)
* Need to test if it correctly checks if reply is public or not
* Need to check/fix clash with time tracking app modal
* Test noTemplate option in manifest file
